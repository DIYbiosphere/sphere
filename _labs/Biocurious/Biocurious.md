## About
We are a complete working laboratory and technical library for entrepreneurs to affordable access equipment, materials, and co-working space; a training center for bio-techniques, with an emphasis on safety; a meeting place for citizen scientists, hobbyists, activists, and students We believe that innovations in biology should be accessible, affordable, and open to everyone.
We’re building a community biology lab for amateurs, inventors, entrepreneurs, and anyone who wants to experiment with friends.

## Equipment and Facilities
We are a fully stocked BSL1 lab with resources similar to a college laboratory. We have about 2500sq/ft of dedicated lab space and 2600sq/ft of office and shared space.
