We from [kat]alab wish for a world in which people of different backgrounds help, inspire and learn from each other. In our opinion that includes also an open access to knowledge, education and technology. Everyone should be able to partake in science independently of companies and universities. Thus knowledge can be more responsive to the particular needs of people and form a strong alliance with art and society. Hence sustainable innovations shall be facilitated that may be able to improve our world.

[kat]alab’s goal is to offer an innovative scientific infrastructure open to all. We want to provide an accessable bio lab for experts in technology, science and art, but also for pupils and students, interested citizens and young companies. Furthermore there will be open space and a café for networking and swapping ideas. Versatile events invite people themselves to spring into action, widen their horizon, to see their own potential and develope it by means of participative leaming opportunities. Thus a network at the joint of science, art and society will be created where people learn from each other and inspire one another.

After a long process of conversations within our team and with people who have experience in the fields of transdisciplinary and especially in biohacking, bioart and citizen science, we finally started to take part at several events in spring and summer 2017. We participated with a workshop and a talk at the bioart event Nature Animée organized by the science-based art collective pavillon_35. Next we attended the biofabbing convention at CERN, we offered a workshop about the hydrological cycle at ‘sacre coeure’ high school in Vienna and took part at a bio mimikry workshop in the Bregenzer Wald region in Vorarlberg, Austria. After we officially founded and registered our association in August 2017, we partook at the open art week end event ‘TransformArte’ in Eisenstadt, Austria. Next we took part of the ‘Researchers’ Night’ event for high school students and last we also attended BioSummit at MIT Media Lab in Boston. Our current main objective is to find a proper space [kat]alab in Vienna.
