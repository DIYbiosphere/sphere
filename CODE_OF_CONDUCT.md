Contributors of the DIYbiosphere must abide by our Code of Conduct\*. It applies to all project and public spaces when representing or engaging with the project or its community, online and offline.

As part of keeping to [Our Values](http://sphere.diybio.org/about/philosophy#our-values), we are committed to having a welcoming environment for all people to contribute, and we pledge to value them as human beings and foster an atmosphere of kindness, cooperation, and understanding. We want to sustain a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion or sexual identity and orientation.

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

- Violent threats or language
- The use of sexually explicit or violent imagery
- Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Repeated harassment of others
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments
- Personal or political attacks
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission to do so (threats included)
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

In general, any conduct that could be considered inappropriate in a professional setting is unacceptable.

# Dealing with Unacceptable Behavior
When instances of unacceptable behavior occur towards you or someone else, you can deal with it:

## Address it directly
Address the wrongdoer, sharing your feelings in response to their behavior and how it hurts you or others. Do not ridicule, insult, etc. On the other hand, if you are the wrongdoer, whether you get called out or you realize on your own, you should apologize directly and ask how you can make it up to that person.

Unacceptable material or language may be directly removed or rejected by members of the [development community].

## Report it
Contact a [director](http://sphere.diybio.org/about/community) if you do not feel comfortable addressing the wrongdoer. Contributors with unacceptable behavior ­­­— be it inappropriate, threatening, offensive or harmful — shall be banned temporarily or permanently. Project directors are obliged to maintain the confidentiality of the incident's reporter, and to remain committed to fairly and consistently reviewing all reports and applying these principles to the project, those who don't may be suspended or removed as directors.
