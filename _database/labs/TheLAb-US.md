## About
The mission of TheLAB is to make science accessible to people of all ages and educational backgrounds. We do this by providing laboratory equipment and workspace, resources which are typically out of the reach of the amateur, to anyone passionate about learning. We organize open meetup days where newcomers can mingle with veterans to exchange ideas and learn about ongoing projects. In addition, we allow members to use our common resources to work on their own research projects. We believe the combination of an open laboratory and cutting edge research projects makes for an exciting learning environment

## History
In January 2010, UCLA Center for Society and Genetics held a conference Outlaw Biology? Public Participation in the Age of Big Bio.  The conference attracted a number of DIYBio mailing list regulars plus some new faces of biologists from around Southern California.  This started the process of coalescing a group of locals interested in biology which would eventually band together to set up an independent bio lab.
