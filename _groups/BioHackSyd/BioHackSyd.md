BioHackSyd is a place to talk about molecular biology from a DIY perspective. We encourage all people to attend regardless of scientific knowledge or expertise to come and listen to a series of talks followed by networking drinks. Talks range from citizen science, bio-inspired art, to more in-depth molecular biology at a university level. We also encourage short demonstrations and show-and-tell at the end for interested people. We meet at the BioFoundry; Australia's first open-to-the-public molecular biology lab. This means that if you come up with the next biotech invention, you are able to explore and create it in a safe and practical manner without having to spend $200,000 on your own lab.
