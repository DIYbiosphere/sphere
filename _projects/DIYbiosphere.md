## About
The DIYbiosphere is an open project of Do-it-Yourself Biology (DIYbio) initiatives from all over the world, accessible (and editable) through the web using GitHub. The goal is to have a common space where the DIYbio community can share about who they are, where, and what they are doing. We believe that a centralized directory could benefit the DIYbio community by increasing visibility to projects, organizations and events. We hope that by connecting people and ideas, they may inspire, learn, and collaborate with each other. Additionally, the project can also serve as a reference point for DIYbio supporters and followers, including journalists, scholars, governmental agencies, and more.
You can learn more about the project and how to contribute in our [About] page, and on how to contribute on our [Contributing] page.


## Origins
The DIYbiosphere was founded by Gabriela A. Sanchez (@sabgaby), a PhD student at the University of Geneva, whose research focus is the DIYbio community. The project was proposed as an alternative mode to gather, access, and share information about DIYbio initiatives in a way that positively contributes useful resources back to the community.
