Bento Lab is a complete DNA laboratory, suitable for a beginner to a professional. It comes with a PCR thermocycler, a centrifuge and a gel electrophoresis box and power supply with blue LED transillumination, and it fits into a laptop-sized bag.

### Starter Kit for DNA Analysis
Bento Lab is ready-to-go laboratory hardware. The Starter Kit contains all the materials needed when learning to use Bento Lab for the first time, including instructions and reagents.

# Mission Statement
### a better future for biology
Genetics and molecular biology are the fundamental technologies of life. They concern all of us. And yet, only a small number of experts have access to laboratories and specialist knowledge. This is a problem caused by equipment that is closed and expensive and hardware and software that is difficult to use.
Instead, let us look at how movements like Arduino or Raspberry Pi are empowering citizens to co-create and be technology-literate.
By building a diverse community around inclusive and accessible molecular biology, we want to enable professionals and non-professionals to engage with genetics in an open and responsible way. This is for everybody: curious makers, ambitious students, innovative artists and cutting-edge scientists.
