Cell Elevens goal is to liberate the private biotechnology and give it to the masses.  By lowering the cost of tools, reagents, and removing the need for advanced technical skills.  As Prometheus stole fire from the Gods and gave it to man, Cell Eleven will liberate biotech and give it to everyone.  The fundamental goal is to have more people working towards a brighter future of longer, healthier lives.
